# Local Swift campaign ledger

This ledger starts from the completed Swift bring-up in `changelog.txt`.

| Result | Finding |
|---|---|
| IQ4_XS rejected | Bounded streaming ran, but dense-weight turnover was about 0.11 tok/s; resident loading triggered the host OOM/SIGKILL path. |
| IQ3_XXS accepted as baseline | Completed 11.67 GiB model; short protected smoke passed; q36-bench measured about 180 tok/s prefill and 23 tok/s generation at context 1024. |
| MTP draft=3 rejected as default | Slower than draft=1 on the measured workload. |
| attention span=128 rejected as default | Helped at context 1024 but regressed at context 2048; span 512 remains the stable default. |

Do not repeat these hypotheses without a new hardware or runtime reason.
Preserve MoE routing parity for the Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 reference on every
accepted change, even when the primary target is dense Swift Qwen3.8.

## Interrupted experiment: 2026-09-17 12:00 (DeepSeek worker)

- **IQ3_XXS dense MMQ lane split — REJECTED/INTERRUPTED:** split the
  `dense_iq3_xxs_mmq` dequant staging across all 128 lanes. The first build
  failed because `half` is a GLSL reserved word; after renaming it, the
  candidate was bit-exact but regressed the down-projection microbenchmark by
  about 2.7% and did not establish an end-to-end win. The compatibility gate
  passed, but the worker was terminated before its required final report.
  Do not retry this lane-split mechanism without a measured explanation for
  the down-projection regression.
